* Assets folder contains HTML files which I include into other files. - They're just assets.


* Media folder contains 6 images for the slide show. And it also contains "boxes" folder
  where the box images are stored.


* Script holds 2 JS documents.
	- script.js - Contains Slideshow
	- script.js - Contains everything else | Drop-down list, Element Creation


* Style folder is for stylesheets.


* PHP documents: about, catalogue, contact, index, products.
  db.php is the connection to the database. I don't keep it in the assets. because it should be outside the server.
  But it's only XAMPP so it's ok.
